# pythonBook
Code written alongside the book - the given examples *and* the set challenges.

This is a repository created for storing my code for the book "Python Programming for the Absolute Beginner, 3rd Edition" by Michael Dawson.
An additional reason for creating this repository is testing out basic GitHub functionality, which can easily be deduced seeing it is my first repository.
